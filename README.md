# xkcd-enhancer-plugin

This is a Chrome plugin to modify the experience of reading comic pages from [xkcd](https://xkcd.com). When you visit a comic page, it makes the following adjustments:

* It adds previous and next buttons top right. These remain fixed in place, so it’s you can easily click through many, many xkcd comics without moving your mouse pointer.
* xkcd comics all have a concluding remark normally revealed by hovering over it. The plugin adds this remark into a yellow box below the comic, so you can read it without the hover.

Largely written by GPT4. Welcome to the era of thinking, “it would be more convenient if this page worked like this,” to asking for a plugin to make the changes, to having it running in under five minutes. 

## How to install

1. Download the repository into a folder
1. In Chrome (or Brave, which is what I use) go to `chrome://extensions`
1. Switch on developer mode
1. Click “load unpacked”
1. Select the repository folder you downloaded

## Example of use
